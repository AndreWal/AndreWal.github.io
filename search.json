    "text": "State Formation and Institutional Design\nMy second major research area is understanding the historical and political foundations of modern state institutions, particularly in the areas of fiscal capacity, taxation, and state-society relationships. Through my research, I have sought to examine how societies respond to profound economic and political challenges such as industrialization, war, and social inequality and how these responses shape the long-term trajectories of taxation. At the heart of my work lies the exploration of state formation as a contested process driven by the interaction of political actors, economic forces, and societal needs. My research demonstrates that the development of fiscal systems is not merely a technical response to external pressures but a deeply political process, shaped by elite competition, public demands, and socio-demographic factors. This insight challenges deterministic accounts of state formation, instead emphasizing the dynamic interplay between institutional reforms and social transformations. I have shown, for example, how moments of crisis — such as wars or economic upheavals — can catalyze profound changes in fiscal policies, but only when aligned with domestic political coalitions and public support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Tax Share across the World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tax Introduction by Canton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) RD Estimations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Tax Vote Results 1918 in Bern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3"
